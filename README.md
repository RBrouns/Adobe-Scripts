# Adobe-Scripts
Scripts I made to automate repetitive tasks in my work

So! Everyone is familiar with performing small, manual operations perhaps 10 or 20 times per day in your favorite software.
These operations are the same every time. To you this may be, saving/copying a file to the same folder each time. To me it is things like:
- Batch-export of the same series of Illustrator artboards, in different file formats/resolutions.
- Automatically update a complete iconset to small style changes (color, rounding, etc)
- Preparing artboards for AE rendering.

So I figured I'd be better off to automate these tasks.
Every script saves me up to 10 or 20 sec per time, adding up to 5 minutes per day, per script.
A single investment of merely an hour, writing a script to perform the task for you, will definitly pay off in the long run!

So there we go, my series of Illustrator and After Effect automation scripts for Adobe ES.
